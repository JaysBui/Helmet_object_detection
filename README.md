# Helmet Object Detection

## 1. Foreword

Welcome to one of my very first repositories. As you may have seen, there are a lot of projects regarding object detection in various fields. This is very crucial safety in construction, helping detect who is not complying with construction rules, especially wearing a headgear!

This repository is hosted on Google Colab and contains only a Jupyter notebook file, which you may find easy to use!

## 2. Usage

1. Access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Clone my repository:
    ```bash
    !git clone https://github.com/JaysBui/Helmet_object_detection.git
    cd Helmet_object_detection
    ```
3. Ensure that you turn on the "GPU" instead of the "CPU" (Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU).
4. Proceed with every step in the 'Helmet_object_detection.ipynb' file.
5. At Step 4, you can use your own image related to the project by setting the `IMAGE_URL` variable.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance!
